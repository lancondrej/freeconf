    <help>The Group directive sets the group under which the server will answer requests. In order to use this directive, the server must be run initially as root. If you start the server as a non-root user, it will fail to change to the specified group, and will instead continue to run as the group of the original user.Unix-group is one of:A username - Refers to the given user by name.# followed by a user number. - Refers to a user by its number.Warning: Don't set Group (or User) to root unless you know exactly what you are doing, and what the dangers are.</help>

  <entry name="DefaultType">

    <help>DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a documentif it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, "text/plain" isa good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applicationsor images, you may want to use "application/octet-stream" instead tokeep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they aretext.</help>
  </entry>
  <entry name="KeepAlive">
    <value>yes</value>
    <help>The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent connection feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection. In some cases this has been shown to result in an almost 50% speedup in latency times for HTML documents with many images. To enable Keep-Alive connections, set KeepAlive On.For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be used if they are specifically requested by a client. In addition, a Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can only be used when the length of the content is known in advance. This implies that dynamic content such as CGI output, SSI pages, and server-generated directory listings will generally not use Keep-Alive connections to HTTP/1.0 clients. For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are the default unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it, chunked encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown length over persistent connections.</help>

Levels are listed in order of decreasing significance.When a particular level is specified, messages from all other levels of higher significance will be reported as well. E.g., when LogLevel info is specified, then messages with log levels of notice and warn will also be posted.Using a level of at least crit is recommended.</help>

  <entry name="LockFile">

    <help>The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache is used with an AcceptMutex value of either fcntl or flock. This directive should normally be left at its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile must be stored on a local disk. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to the filename.</help>

        <help>The Order directive, along with the Allow and Deny directives, controls a three-pass access control system. The first pass processes either all Allow or all Deny directives, as specified by the Order directive. The second pass parses the rest of the directives (Deny or Allow). The third pass applies to all requests which do not match either of the first two.Note that all Allow and Deny directives are processed, unlike a typical firewall, where only the first match is used. The last match is effective (also unlike a typical firewall). Additionally, the order in which lines appear in the configuration files is not significant -- all Allow lines are processed as one group, all Deny lines are considered as another, and the default state is considered by itself.</help>
